# VerkadaChallenge - Angular

## Explanation on saved output
I chose to repesent camera orientation with integer for this challenge. It keep the floor plan arrays typed and easy to store. 

2 is north
3 is south
4 is east
5 is west

If we were to implement something similar in production, it would probably be better to wrap everything in objects since we might have more properties than just orientation.

## Development server

Run `ng serve --open` for a dev server.

Still working on a 3d version of this in React...
